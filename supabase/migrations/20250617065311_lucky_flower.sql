  # Fix RLS Policies for Database Access

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop overly restrictive RLS policies that are blocking application access
    - Create new policies that allow read access for all users (public and authenticated)
    - Enable insert/update access for authenticated users and anonymous users where needed
    - Maintain reasonable security while allowing the application to function

  2. Tables Updated
    - `death_predictions` - Allow public read, authenticated insert
    - `death_markets` - Allow public read, authenticated insert
    - `death_bets` - Allow public read, authenticated insert
    - `digital_legacies` - Allow user-specific access
    - `life_extensions` - Allow user-specific access
    - `user_subscriptions` - Allow user-specific access
    - `death_verifications` - Admin-only access

  3. Notes
    - These policies balance functionality with security
    - Anonymous users can view public data (leaderboards, markets)
    - Authenticated users can create and manage their own data
